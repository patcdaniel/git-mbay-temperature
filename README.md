New Feature


## Project Overview

This project analyzes the seawater intake temperature data from the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The goal is to understand temperature trends and their potential impact on marine life.

## Data

The dataset includes daily temperature readings from the seawater intake system at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The data spans multiple years and is stored in a CSV file.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

To perform the analysis, you will first need to download the data from the CeNCOOS ERDDAP server.

__Download Data__
```bash
./src/download_data.sh
```
__Generate Figures__
```bash
python analyze_temperature.py
```

## Results

The results of the analysis will be saved in the `results` directory, including plots. Two plots are generate. First a timeseries of sea water temeperature with a 40 hour 'hann' low pass filter applied. Second, a scatter plot of temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation.
